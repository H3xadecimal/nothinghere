    I originally didn't intend this page to contain, well anything, the domain was purchased and meant to be used
    as a cloud service and other backend/api stuff but due to reasons, that didn't happen.
    Now all this is used for is, well, learning.
    What else can i do with it?

    //Hacktober 2020//
    
    I know, i know, Hacktober is meant for Open Source software, but for me i see it as an opportunity,
    as a reason, to get into coding. I am not a developer, never was, never will be. All i do is code a website
    from time to time as a little project or learning experience, or make some python scripts to automate windows operations.
    I'd love to become a, somewhat, knowledgable developer, enough to actually be helpful to people, but unfortunately,
    due to personal reasons, i can't.
